# Human-activity-recognition
Predicting the action of human such as walking, sitting, standing etc using Machine learning algorithms and neural networks

1. Information about how data was collected can be found here --> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
2. You can check the experiment here --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A
3. You can also download the data set directly from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/ 
4. You can also download the data from the Train and Test data in folder in this repository.
5. There are three file. The "HAR_creating_dataset" file contain creating and brief data visualization. The "HAR_project_model" files contain implementation of machine learning algorithms on the data set. The "HAR neural network" file contain implemention of neural network on data set. Hyper paramater tuning is also done for all models.
